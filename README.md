# Titanic-Machine-Learning-Project
This Project looks into using machine learning classification model to predict passenger that survived in the titanic shipwreck using their socio economic background


Everyone who watch the Titanic movie was so touched by the tragedy even tho it was a beautiful love story. When i first stumbled on this project on kaggle, I find it interesting and i was really anxious to know what influences the survival and death rate of passengers. I started out by going back to rewatch the Titanic movie (even tho i was sure i would cry my eyes out :)) to gain more insights about the data. I draw my insights out then i started the project by assessing the data on visually on excel files where i found some quality and tidiness issues which includes missing data, titles are added to names amongst others. I then assessed the data programmatically using pandas (a python library) to generate more insights about the data After the data has been assessed, i wrangled the data to remove duplicated rows, missing columns and make the data ready for modelling using pandas and numpy library. I then visualized the data to generate insights and to know which column is most important using matplotlib library. After this analysis was performed, the data was ready for modelling. the data was a classification data and i used
